# hmt-re-framework
This repository contains supplementary material for the paper "A Model-Based Framework for Exploring HMT Requirements in CPS".

It is organized as follows:
  - The root directory contains the source file of the model showcasing the framework's overall methodology process, as well as a PDF version.
  - The folder **framework-application-support** contains various checklists that we have created to support some of the areas of activity of the methodology process.
  - The folder **framework-demonstration** contains all models that we created as part of using the framework to build and explore a scenario relating to CPS-supported logistics in order to show its feasibility. For each model, the source file and a PDF version is provided.
  - The folder **framework-evaluation** contains the interview guide that we employed for expert evaluations of the framework, as well as theoretical inputs that informed some of the guide's questions.
