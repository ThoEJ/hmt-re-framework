Theoretical Input for Interview Guide
=====================================

The following important factors for designing HMT and putting it into operation, according to Ref. [1], have been used as basis for some of the following questions in the interview guide (related to objective 1):

| Item | Description |
| -------- | -------- |
| Item 1 | The identification of "clear-cut individual roles of both human and machine is the basic and primary element of HMT operations". |
| Item 2 | Based on the technology, "room for customization to tailor meet any specific application scenario". |
| Item 3 | Identification of team combinations in terms of actors collaborating as a team. |
| Item 4 | Proper technology training should be provided to the humans before proceeding to engage in a HMT task. |
| Item 5 | Establish team operational rules to meet mission objectives without any occupational hazards to any of the team members. |
| Item 6 | Team performance in actual work setting including team training, in order measure actual improvements. |
| Item 7 | Testing task scenarios "with the HMT to understand any process flow deficiencies that may exist". |
| Item 8 | Validation trials "to accommodate for any dynamic changes in work methods and performance objectives". |

Guiding Questions for Semi-Structured Expert Interview:

| Introduction |
| -------- |
| What is your professional experience concerning RE for CPS? |
| What is your professional experience concerning HMT? |
| What is your professional experience concerning modeling languages? |

| Main Objective 1 &ndash; Structured Treatment of HMT Considerations |
| -------- |
| To what extent can the individual roles of both human and machine agents in the CPS be clearly defined?  |
| To what extent can the CPS be tailored to any specific application scenario (regardless of the applied CPS technology)? |
| To what extent does the approach support the specification of HMT combinations for a specific CPS? |
| To what extent can the approach support the identification of useful HMT requirements? |
| To what extent can operational rules be defined, so that CPS objectives can be met without any occupational hazards to any of the human agents? |
| To what extent does the approach allow for the measuring of actual improvements to optimize a CPS? |
| To what extent can scenarios be tested with regard to HMT, in order to recognize CPS process flow deficiencies that may exist? |
| To what extent does the approach allow for validation trials to capture changes in work methods and performance objectives when operating the CPS? |
| How could the treatment of HMT considerations be further improved? |

| Side Objective 2 &ndash; Traceable Process and Understandable Design Representations |
| -------- |
| To what extent is the methodology process transparent and traceable? |
| To what extent are the used model representations understandable for different domain stakeholders that may be involved? |
| How could transparency, traceability, and understandability be further improved? |

| Side Objective 3 &ndash; Ability to Deal with Characteristics of CPS/CPS Development |
| -------- |
| To what extent can the methodology process address the dynamic nature of CPS development? |
| To what extent does the layered model creation approach help in dealing with the complexity of the CPS? |
| To what extent can the subject-oriented modeling approach address CPS heterogeneity? |
| How could the consideration of these CPS characteristics be further improved? |

| Meta-Level Questions |
| -------- |
| To what extent are the current objectives (O1 &ndash; structured treatment of HMT considerations, O2 &ndash; traceable process and understandable representations for different stakeholders, and O3 &ndash; ability to deal with characteristics of CPS/CPS Development) that are being pursued appropriate/practically important in this domain? |
| What additional qualities may prove worthwhile to consider? |
