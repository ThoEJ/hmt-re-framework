Guiding Questions for Semi-Structured Expert Interview:

| Main Objective 1 - Structured Treatment of HMT Considerations |
| -------- |
| To what extent can the individual roles of both human and machine agents in the CPS clearly defined?  |
| To what extent can the CPS be tailored to any specific application scenario (regardless of the applied CPS technology)? |
| To what extent does the approach support the specification of HMT combinations for a specific CPS? |
| To what extent can operational rules be defined, so that CPS objectives can be met without any occupational hazards to any of the human agents? |
| To what extent does the approach allow for the measuring of actual improvements to optimize a CPS? |
| To what extent can scenarios be tested with regard to HMT, in order to recognize CPS process flow deficiencies that may exist? |
| To what extent does the approach allow for validation trials to capture changes in work methods and performance objectives when operating the CPS? |
| How could the treatment of HMT considerations be further improved? |

| Side Objective 2 - Traceable Process and Understandable Design Representations |
| -------- |
| To what extent is the methodology process transparent and traceable? |
| To what extent are the used model representations understandable for different domain stakeholders that may be involved? |
| How could transparency, traceability, and understandabiltiy be further improved? |

| Side Objective 3 - Ability to Deal with Characteristics of CPS/CPS Development |
| -------- |
| To what extent can the methodology process address the dynamic nature of CPS development? |
| To what extent does the layered model creation approach help in dealing with the complexity of the CPS? |
| To what extent can the subject-oriented modeling approach address CPS heterogeneity? |
| How could the consideration of these CPS characteristics be further improved? |

| Meta-Level Questions |
| -------- |
| To what extent are the current objectives (O1 - structured and traceable treatment of HMT consideration, O2 - understandable representations for different stakeholders, and O3 - ability to deal with dynamic adaptations) that are being pursued appropriate/practically important in this domain? |
| What additional qualities may prove worthwhile to consider? |
