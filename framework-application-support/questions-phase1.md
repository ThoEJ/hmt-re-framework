Activity 1.2 -- Questions to help with the identification of behavior bundles and communication flows based on use case context as candidates for subjects and message exchanges.
| Identification of Behavior Bundles, Communication Flows, and Human/Machine Agents |
| -------- | 
| What activities are generally needed to accomplish the use case? | 
| Considering existing systems that should be replaced, what activities did they perform? | 
| Considering other systems that the CPS should interact with, what activities do/should they perform? | 
| Considering the previously identified stakeholders, what activities do/should they perform? |
| Which functionalities/features could the CPS provide and which corresponding activities are necessary? |
| How could relevant activities be organized to form distinct bundles of thematically related behavior needed to accomplish the use case? |
| What types information/physical resources are needed to provide these behavior bundles? |
| What types information/physical resources need to be exchanged between different behavior bundles? |
| What kind of physical/digital components could the CPS be composed of? |
