Activity 2.1 -- Questions to help analyse a concrete instance of a process problem according to HMT dimensions.
| Transparency |
| -------- |
| *Observability*: How could the problem be detected by a HA/MA? |
| *Predictability*: How well could the next intended action of the HA/MA be inferred? |

| Augmented Cognition |
| -------- |
| *Directing Attention*: How could the HA/MA be made aware of the problem? |
| *Solution Exploration*: How could the HA/MA be supported in finding candidate solutions for solving the problem? |
| *Adaptability*: How could the HA/MA select the best solutions and solve the problem? |

| Coordination |
| -------- |
| *Directability*: How well could the HA direct the resources of the the MA? |
| *Calibrated Trust*: How could the level between the HA and the MA be improved? |
| *Common Ground*: How could the sharing of knowledge (beliefs, assumptions?) between the HA and the MA be improved? |
